add corpses to rooms

head bobs on the hover boards

add score signs in addition to warning signs, 
so the player can see their progress without the need of a direct GUI

smooth camera limits

shuffle room playlist (no repeat, until every room has appeared)

add coin slot to inventory

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

make door an object instead of a tile?

fix weird player movement (teleport?) (probably weird infinite velocity or x/0)

remove rooms when you're past them

Rewrite bag's input method, breaks when you keep holding the mouse when switching inventory

Bag sounds get cut off when closing the bags (only if the items will drop) 
	-fix with audio autoload script
