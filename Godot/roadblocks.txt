CK- Reality Restructuring Event: restructure game state handling (sequence of events)

- create new camera (for what though? xD)

determine amount of items by using rooms tiles add item rarity to generation 
(rewrite generate_items() again to use number of max items/ ground tiles instead of of looping till it fits)
add random offset to item generation within tile

rewrite room so it doesn't matter what layer you use ('layers' array)

only when talking to hero, open bag & equip slots

add difficulty buffer (start with better items) (depends on roomcount) starts at 10, drops with 2 for every subsequent room

fix weird player movement (teleport?) (probably weird infinite velocity or x/0)

add start room

make intro sequence

add multiple warning signs to each rooms

implement sounds + music

PARALELL:

	- fix web build!
	
	- fill in item_stats.json

	- make rooms

add wildcards physically in the game

STRETCH GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

smooth camera limits

add fancy bag opening fade and zoom (cam setting , offset = -20) ((FIX ZOOMING)) 
add gaussian blur to bag zoom background

shuffle room playlist (no repeat, until every room has appeared)

add thanos snap animations to ground_items when timer runs out 

add coin slot to inventory

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

make door an object instead of a tile?

remove rooms when you're past them

MEETING

give me stuff as soon as its sorta done, you can always update it later if you want

font for dialogue? / other things like a box?

item rarity is relative to other items (item w r:1 is 13x as rare compared to item r:13)

futuristic signs/ scoreboard spread around rooms to let you know the score of teh game (to avoid actual menus ofcourse)
