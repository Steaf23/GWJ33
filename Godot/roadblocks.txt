random ground item location generation works, but the subsequent new rooms generate items in wrong positions

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

when talking to hero, open bag + equip slots

after exiting hero equip bag, generate && force player to next room  (start at local room coord Pos 240, 80)

remember movedir when stopped for right idle direction

player is moving the wrong legs when walking with a flipped sprite

add snap animations to ground_items when timer runs out

fix dialogue system
