CK- Reality Restructuring Event: restructure game state handling (sequence of events)

- create new camera (for what though? xD)

add difficulty buffer (start with better items) (depends on roomcount) starts at 10, drops with 2 for every subsequent room

fix weird player movement (teleport?) (probably weird infinite velocity or x/0)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SATURDAY NIGHT CRUNCHIN'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

timer is weirdly ordered (items can still dissapear right after they generation between room transitions)

add start room

make intro sequence

add multiple warning signs to each rooms

implement sounds + music

PARALELL:

	- fix web build!
	
	- fill in item_stats.json

	- make rooms

add wildcards physically in the game

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRETCH GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

add score signs in addition to warning signs , so the player can see their progress without the need of a direct GUI

smooth camera limits

add fancy bag opening fade and zoom (cam setting , offset = -20) ((FIX ZOOMING)) 
add gaussian blur to bag zoom background a.k.a. NESTING VIEWPORTS OMG WTF >:(

shuffle room playlist (no repeat, until every room has appeared)

add thanos snap animations to ground_items when timer runs out 

add coin slot to inventory

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

make door an object instead of a tile?

remove rooms when you're past them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEETING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

give me stuff as soon as its sorta done, you can always update it later if you want

font for dialogue? / other things like a box?

item rarity is relative to other items (item w r:1 is 13x as rare compared to item r:13)
