add corpses to rooms

head bobs on the hover boards

add score signs in addition to warning signs, so the player can see their progress without the need of a direct GUI

smooth camera limits

shuffle room playlist (no repeat, until every room has appeared)

add thanos snap animations to ground_items when timer runs out 

add coin slot to inventory

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

make door an object instead of a tile?

fix weird player movement (teleport?) (probably weird infinite velocity or x/0)

remove rooms when you're past them
