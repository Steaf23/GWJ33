GETTIG FREAKY ON A FRIDAY NIGHT? 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CK- Reality Restructuring Event: restructure game state handling (sequence of events)

- create new camera

- dungeons shouldn't care about what layer the ground is (just get the tiles from the room , room figures out which tiles those are)
	(create room#to_dungeon_space() method??)

determine amount of items by using rooms tiles add item rarity to generation 
(rewrite generate_items() again to use number of max items/ ground tiles instead of of looping till it fits)
add random offset to item generation within tile

only when talking to hero, open bag & equip slots

add difficulty buffer (start with better items) (depends on roomcount) starts at 10, drops with 2 for every subsequent room

fix weird player movement (teleport?) (probably weird infinite velocity or x/0)

add start room

make intro sequence

add multiple warning signs to each rooms

implement sounds + music

PARALELL:

	- fix web build!
	
	- fill in item_stats.json

	- make rooms

add wildcards physically in the game

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STRETCH GOALS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

smooth camera limits

add fancy bag opening fade and zoom (cam setting , offset = -20) ((FIX ZOOMING)) 
add gaussian blur to bag zoom background

shuffle room playlist (no repeat, until every room has appeared)

add thanos snap animations to ground_items when timer runs out 

add coin slot to inventory

when items drop, make them drop in a nice arc (or at least with an animation)

make door an object instead of a tile?

remove rooms when you're past them

MEETING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
